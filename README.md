I was given [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) of [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015)'s to follow, mirroring its structure, typography and colors as I built my own conference website.

After some cursory research, I discovered that the next UN "Conference of the Parties" is due to take place in the UK next year, and I decided this would be the conference for which I would build my website.
